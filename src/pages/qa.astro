                <div class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                  <p class="mb-3">The best algorithm depends on your specific needs:</p>
                  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Pattern Solving:</strong> Fastest for all puzzle sizes but may not provide the shortest solution path</li>
                    <li><strong>A* with Manhattan Distance:</strong> Good balance of speed and solution quality for 8 and 15 puzzles</li>
                    <li><strong>A* with Linear Conflict:</strong> Better solution quality than Manhattan, but slower</li>
                    <li><strong>IDA*:</strong> Guarantees the shortest solution but significantly slower for larger puzzles</li>
                    <li><strong>Bidirectional BFS:</strong> Very effective for 8 puzzles but memory-intensive for larger puzzles</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="mt-3">For beginners, we recommend starting with Pattern Solving or A* with Manhattan Distance.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg leading-6 font-medium text-gray-900">Why do solution times vary so much?</h3>
                <div class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                  <p>Solution times depend on several factors:</p>
                  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Puzzle complexity:</strong> The further from the solution, the longer it takes</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithm choice:</strong> Different algorithms have different time-space tradeoffs</li>
                    <li><strong>Puzzle size:</strong> Larger puzzles have exponentially larger state spaces</li>
                    <li><strong>Your device:</strong> Faster devices will compute solutions more quickly</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="mt-3">A 15 puzzle has approximately 10^13 possible states, while an 8 puzzle has only about 10^5, making the 15 puzzle significantly more challenging to solve.</p>

                  <p class="mb-3">Our solver implements several advanced search algorithms:</p>
                  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
                    <li>
                      <strong>Pattern Solving:</strong> A strategic approach that solves the puzzle row by row and column by column, similar to how humans typically solve these puzzles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>A* Search:</strong> An informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to guide its search toward the goal state. We offer several heuristics:
                      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1">
                        <li><strong>Manhattan Distance:</strong> Calculates the sum of horizontal and vertical distances each tile is from its goal position</li>
                        <li><strong>Misplaced Tiles:</strong> Counts how many tiles are not in their correct position</li>
                        <li><strong>Linear Conflict:</strong> Enhances Manhattan distance by accounting for tiles that are in the correct row/column but in the wrong order</li>

                      <strong>Bidirectional BFS:</strong> Searches simultaneously from both the initial state and goal state, meeting in the middle

                  <p>No, not all configurations of sliding puzzles are solvable. Exactly half of all possible arrangements are unsolvable.</p>
                  <p class="mt-3">Whether a puzzle is solvable depends on a mathematical property called "parity" or "inversion count":</p>
                  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
                    <li>For odd-sized grids (3×3, 5×5, etc.), a puzzle is solvable if the number of inversions is even</li>
                    <li>For even-sized grids (4×4, 6×6, etc.), a puzzle is solvable if:
                      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1">
                        <li>The number of inversions is even and the blank is on an odd row (counting from the bottom)</li>

                <div class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                  <p>Our solver supports puzzles from 2×2 up to 9×9 sizes, though solving times increase significantly for larger puzzles:</p>
                  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>2×2 to 4×4:</strong> All algorithms work efficiently</li>
                    <li><strong>5×5 to 6×6:</strong> Pattern solving recommended; A* algorithms may work for moderately scrambled puzzles</li>
                    <li><strong>7×7 to 9×9:</strong> Only pattern solving is practical; other algorithms may time out</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="mt-3">For puzzles larger than 5×5, we recommend using the pattern solving algorithm exclusively, as it scales much better to larger puzzle sizes.</p>

                <div class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                  <p>If the solver indicates "No solution found," it means one of two things:</p>
                  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
                    <li>The puzzle configuration is unsolvable (mathematically impossible)</li>

                  </ul>
                  <p class="mt-3">For complex configurations on larger puzzles, try switching to the Pattern Solving algorithm, which is more efficient but may produce slightly longer solution paths.</p>
                  <p class="mt-3">If you believe your puzzle should be solvable but keeps failing, double-check that you've entered it correctly. A single misplaced tile can make a solvable puzzle unsolvable.</p>
